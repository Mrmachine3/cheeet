* Intro
  It's so diffcuclt for me to remember various parameters and keybinds.

  I find rofi could help me do that, just write them into files and then use =rofi= to query. So I wrote a litte script and a concise rofi theme.

  Currently I am using org-mode for formatting cheatsheet files, and maybe I would write a script to do that someday.

  Hope this script could help people facing the problem of reciting parameters and keybinds.

  Share your cheasheet.
