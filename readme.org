* Intro
  It's so diffcuclt for me to remember various parameters and keybinds.
  I find rofi could help me do that, just write them into files and then use =rofi= to query. So I wrote a litte script and a concise rofi theme.
  Currently I am using org-mode for formatting cheatsheet files, and maybe I would write a script to do that someday.
  Hope this script could help people facing the problem of reciting parameters and keybinds.
  Open for PR and cheatsheet.
  
** Cheatsheet file structure
	| App or command | keybind or parameter | Description |
	- The first line is for prompt, just copy this line
	- The other lines should be contents
